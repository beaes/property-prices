# some python tasks

Here there are a handful of some Python tasks which I have made during the trainings: 'Basics of Python' conducted by 'Akademia kodu', which were taking place in 30.05.2020 and 26.10.2020, respectively.
The first training took 4 hours while the second 7 hours. Both trainings were held in the form of lectures and exercises and were confirmed with an appropriate certificate (after passing the final test).
